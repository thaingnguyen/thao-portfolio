## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🎨 Theme Tokens

Color usage is centralized through semantic tokens:

- `src/styles/global.css` defines the palette with CSS variables (e.g. `--color-surface`, `--color-accent-primary`).
- `src/styles/global.css` configures Tailwind via `@theme`, exposing utilities like `bg-surface-alt`, `text-foreground-muted`, and `text-accent-primary`.
- Components should rely on those tokens/utilities instead of hard-coded hex values or default Tailwind color names. Run `rg '#[0-9a-fA-F]' src` to ensure new literals aren't introduced.

This makes it easy to re-theme the site by overriding the shared variables (including future light/dark modes) without touching component markup.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
