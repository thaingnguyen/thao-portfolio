# Story 1.2: Global Styles & Layout

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Developer,
**I want** to configure the global styles, fonts (Poppins, Inter), and the main application layout,
**so that** all subsequent components inherit the correct branding and structure.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The `src/styles/globals.css` file is configured with Tailwind's base styles.
2. The Poppins and Inter fonts are imported and configured for use in the application.
3. The root layout (`src/layouts/Layout.astro`) is set up to apply the base background color (`#1A202C`) and font styles to the entire application.
4. The `src/styles/globals.css` file is updated with the project's custom color palette and font families.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Configure `src/styles/globals.css` with the theme colors and fonts from the architecture doc.
- [x] Import Poppins and Inter fonts in `src/layouts/Layout.astro`.
- [x] Apply the font classes to the `<body>` tag in the root layout.
- [x] Remove any default Astro boilerplate styling.

## Dev Notes
- **Relevant Architecture:** Section 8 (Styling Guidelines) of the Frontend Architecture Document.
- **Fonts:** Poppins (display), Inter (sans).
- **Colors:** Primary: `#1A202C`, Accent: `#38B2AC`, etc.
- **Action:** This story sets the visual foundation for the entire project. Ensure the `tailwind.config.mjs` and `Layout.astro` are correctly configured before moving on.

## Testing
- Per the architecture document, testing implementation is deferred for now.
