# Story 1.10: Add Animations & Micro-interactions

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** User,
**I want** to experience subtle and sophisticated animations,
**so that** the website feels polished, modern, and delightful to use.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Sections fade in gently as the user scrolls down the page.
2. Interactive elements (buttons, links) have a subtle hover effect.
3. The interactive elements of the Hero section have a hover effect.
4. The interactive elements of the Journey section (desktop timeline) are implemented.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Use CSS animations to create the fade-in-on-scroll effect.
- [ ] Add CSS transitions to buttons and links for simple micro-interactions.
- [ ] Implement the desktop-only timeline/dot navigation for the Journey section, using client-side JavaScript to show the active card.
- [ ] Implement the interactive carousels for the Project Showcase sections, using a lightweight JavaScript library if necessary.

## Dev Notes
- **Relevant UX Spec:** Section 9 (Animation & Micro-interactions).
- **Action:** This story introduces client-side interactivity. The focus is on creating a premium feel. The carousels will be the most complex part of this story.

## Testing
- Per the architecture document, testing implementation is deferred for now.
