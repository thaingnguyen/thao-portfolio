# Story 1.6: Build the Project Showcases

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Hiring Manager,
**I want** to explore the candidate's key projects in an interactive carousel,
**so that** I can see tangible proof of their client-side and agency-side accomplishments.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Two distinct sections are created: "Client-Side Impact" and "Agency-Side Delivery".
2. Each section contains a placeholder for a project carousel.
3. For the MVP, only the first project for each section is displayed statically.
4. The displayed project shows a title, a key impact/delivery stat, and the user's role.
5. The layout is responsive and visually consistent between the two sections.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Add mock data for the projects to `src/lib/data.ts`.
- [ ] Implement the `ClientProjectsSection` component.
- [ ] Implement the `AgencyProjectsSection` component.
- [ ] Create a reusable `ProjectCard` component to display the project details.
- [ ] Ensure the styling is consistent for both sections.
- [ ] Use responsive classes to ensure the layout works on all screen sizes.

## Dev Notes
- **Relevant UX Spec:** Section 4.1 (Screen: Project Showcase).
- **Action:** This story focuses on the static display of the project information. The interactive carousel functionality will be implemented in a later story.
- **Data:** All project data should come from `src/lib/data.ts`.

## Testing
- Per the architecture document, testing implementation is deferred for now.
