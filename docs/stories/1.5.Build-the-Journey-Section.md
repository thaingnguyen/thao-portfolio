# Story 1.5: Build the Journey Section

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Hiring Manager,
**I want** to view a curated timeline of the candidate's pivotal career moments,
**so that** I can quickly understand their growth and impact.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The Journey Section displays a section title "My Journey".
2. It contains cards for at least three "pivotal moments" using mock data.
3. Each card displays a title, and a short description.
4. On desktop (>=768px), the cards are laid out horizontally.
5. On mobile (<768px), the cards are stacked vertically.
6. The layout is clean, readable, and follows the established style guide.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create a `src/lib/data.ts` file to store the mock data for the journey cards.
- [ ] Implement the Journey Section component in `src/components/sections/02-journey-section.astro`.
- [ ] Create a reusable `StoryCard` component in `src/components/ui/`.
- [ ] Map over the mock data to render the `StoryCard` components.
- [ ] Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes (e.g., `md:flex-row`) to handle the layout change between mobile and desktop.

## Dev Notes
- **Relevant UX Spec:** Section 4.1 (Screen: The Journey).
- **Data:** All text content should be imported from `src/lib/data.ts` to keep the component clean.
- **Action:** Focus on the responsive layout. The desktop timeline/dot navigation will be added in a later story (Story 1.10).

## Testing
- Per the architecture document, testing implementation is deferred for now.
