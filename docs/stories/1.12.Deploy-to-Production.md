# Story 1.12: Deploy to Production

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Creative Marketer,
**I want** my portfolio website to be deployed to a public URL,
**so that** I can share it with potential employers.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The Astro application is configured for static export.
2. The project is connected to a hosting provider (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).
3. A production build is successfully created and deployed.
4. The deployed site is accessible via a public URL.
5. All assets (images, fonts) load correctly on the deployed site.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Configure `astro.config.mjs` for static site generation (`output: 'static'`).
- [ ] Create a new project on Vercel/Netlify and connect it to the Git repository.
- [ ] Configure the build settings on the hosting provider.
- [ ] Trigger a deployment and verify that it builds successfully.
- [ ] Test the live URL to ensure the site is fully functional.

## Dev Notes
- **Relevant Architecture:** Section 1 (Template and Framework Selection) - decision to use SSG.
- **Hosting:** Vercel and Netlify are excellent hosts for Astro projects.
- **Action:** This is the final step to make the project live.

## Testing
- Per the architecture document, testing implementation is deferred for now.
