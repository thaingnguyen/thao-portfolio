# Story 1.3: Static Component Scaffolding

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Developer,
**I want** to create placeholder components for the six main sections of the page,
**so that** the overall information architecture is established.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Six new component files are created in `src/components/sections/`.
2. Each component file is named according to the architecture plan (e.g., `01-hero-section.astro`).
3. Each component renders a simple `section` element with an `id` and a placeholder `h2` title (e.g., "Hero Section").
4. The main page (`src/pages/index.astro`) imports and renders these six components in the correct order.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create `src/components/sections/01-hero-section.astro`.
- [x] Create `src/components/sections/02-journey-section.astro`.
- [x] Create `src/components/sections/03-client-projects-section.astro`.
- [x] Create `src/components/sections/04-agency-projects-section.astro`.
- [x] Create `src/components/sections/05-skills-section.astro`.
- [x] Create `src/components/sections/06-connect-section.astro`.
- [x] Update `src/pages/index.astro` to render the new section components.

## Dev Notes
- **Relevant Architecture:** Section 3 (Project Structure) of the Frontend Architecture Document.
- **Action:** This story is about setting up the skeleton of the main page. The components should be minimal placeholders. The focus is on file structure and import/export correctness.

## Testing
- Per the architecture document, testing implementation is deferred for now.
