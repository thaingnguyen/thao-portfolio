# Story 1.9: Implement Sticky Navigation

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** User,
**I want** a sticky navigation bar,
**so that** I can easily jump between sections of the page without having to scroll manually.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A navigation header component is created.
2. The header is fixed ("sticky") to the top of the viewport and is always visible.
3. The header contains links that correspond to the main sections of the page (Journey, Projects, Skills, Contact).
4. Clicking a link smoothly scrolls the page to the corresponding section.
5. On mobile (<768px), the navigation collapses into a "hamburger" menu.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create a `Header` component.
- [ ] Add the `Header` component to the root layout (`src/layouts/Layout.astro`).
- [ ] Use Tailwind classes (`fixed`, `top-0`, `w-full`) to make the header sticky.
- [ ] Implement the anchor links (`<a href="#journey">`).
- [ ] Use CSS (`scroll-behavior: smooth`) for the smooth scrolling effect.
- [ ] Implement the mobile hamburger menu, which can toggle a navigation overlay.

## Dev Notes
- **Relevant UX Spec:** Section 2.2 (Navigation Structure).
- **Action:** The hamburger menu will require client-side JavaScript. We will use a small amount of vanilla JavaScript to handle the open/closed state.

## Testing
- Per the architecture document, testing implementation is deferred for now.
