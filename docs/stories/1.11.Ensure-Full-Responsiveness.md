# Story 1.11: Ensure Full Responsiveness

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** User,
**I want** the portfolio to be perfectly usable and visually appealing on any device,
**so that** I can view it from my mobile phone to my desktop computer.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All sections are tested and confirmed to be visually correct at four key breakpoints: mobile (320px), tablet (768px), desktop (1024px), and wide (1440px).
2. There is no horizontal overflow on any screen size.
3. Text is readable and touch targets are appropriately sized (>=44px) on mobile devices.
4. The mobile navigation works correctly and is easy to use.
5. All interactive elements (carousels, timeline) are fully functional on touch devices.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Use browser developer tools to test the site at all specified breakpoints.
- [ ] Adjust Tailwind CSS responsive utility classes as needed to fix layout issues.
- [ ] Verify that all text wraps correctly and does not overflow its container.
- [ ] Test all interactive elements on a physical mobile device or a high-fidelity emulator.

## Dev Notes
- **Relevant UX Spec:** Section 8 (Responsiveness Strategy).
- **Action:** This is a comprehensive review and refinement story. The goal is to catch and fix all visual bugs related to responsiveness before deployment.

## Testing
- Per the architecture document, testing implementation is deferred for now.
