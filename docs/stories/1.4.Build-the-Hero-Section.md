# Story 1.4: Build the Hero Section

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Hiring Manager,
**I want** to see a visually striking hero section with a clear value proposition,
**so that** I am immediately intrigued and understand the candidate's unique strengths.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The Hero Section component fills the full viewport height (`100vh`).
2. The headline "Campaigns that Perform. Creative that Inspires." is displayed prominently.
3. The sub-headline "Thao Nguyen | Creative Marketer" is visible below the main headline.
4. The abstract split-screen background concept is implemented (can be a static gradient or simple color split for now).
5. A subtle "scroll down" affordance is present.
6. The section is responsive and looks good on mobile devices.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Implement the full-screen layout for the section.
- [x] Add the H1 and P tag for the headlines, styled according to the style guide.
- [x] Create the two-part background using Tailwind CSS classes.
- [x] Add a simple scroll-down icon.
- [x] Use mobile-first responsive classes to ensure the layout adapts correctly.

## Dev Notes
- **Relevant UX Spec:** Section 4.1 (Screen: Homepage).
- **Relevant Architecture:** Component will be built in `src/components/sections/01-hero-section.astro`.
- **Styling:** Use colors and typography from `tailwind.config.mjs`.
- **Action:** This is the first visual component. Pay close attention to centering and typography details.

## Testing
- Per the architecture document, testing implementation is deferred for now.
