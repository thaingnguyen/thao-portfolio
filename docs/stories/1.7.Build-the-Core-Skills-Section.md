# Story 1.7: Build the Core Skills Section

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Recruiter,
**I want** to see a clearly organized, two-column list of strategic and creative skills,
**so that** I can quickly scan for relevant keywords and competencies.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The Core Skills section displays the title "Core Competencies".
2. On desktop (>=768px), the skills are displayed in two columns: "Strategic & Analytical" and "Creative & Conceptual".
3. On mobile (<768px), the two columns stack vertically.
4. Each column contains a list of at least three skills, populated from mock data.
5. The layout is clean, scannable, and adheres to the style guide.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Add mock data for the skills to `src/lib/data.ts`.
- [ ] Implement the `SkillsSection` component.
- [ ] Use a CSS Grid or Flexbox with Tailwind's responsive prefixes to create the two-column layout.
- [ ] Map over the skills data to render the lists.

## Dev Notes
- **Relevant UX Spec:** Section 5 (Component Library / Design System) - "Left Brain / Right Brain" layout.
- **Action:** The key challenge here is the responsive column layout. Ensure it stacks correctly on smaller screens.

## Testing
- Per the architecture document, testing implementation is deferred for now.
