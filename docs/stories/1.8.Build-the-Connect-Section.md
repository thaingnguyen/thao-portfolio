# Story 1.8: Build the Connect Section

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Hiring Manager,
**I want** a clear and simple way to contact the candidate,
**so that** I can easily take the next step after being impressed by their portfolio.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The Connect Section is styled as a page footer.
2. It contains the headline "Let's Build Something Great Together."
3. A prominent "SAY HELLO" button is displayed.
4. The button is a `mailto:` link that opens the user's default email client.
5. Icons linking to LinkedIn and providing the email address are present.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement the `ConnectSection` component.
- [ ] Style the section with a dark background and centered text.
- [ ] Create a primary CTA button component in `src/components/ui/button.astro`.
- [ ] Implement the `mailto:` link on the button.
- [ ] Add placeholder icons for social/contact links.

## Dev Notes
- **Relevant UX Spec:** Section 6 (Let's Connect).
- **Component:** This is a good opportunity to create the reusable `Button` component that will be used elsewhere.
- **Action:** Ensure the `mailto:` link is correctly formatted.

## Testing
- Per the architecture document, testing implementation is deferred for now.
